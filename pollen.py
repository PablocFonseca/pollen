""" Logic of Weights 
# create 3 weights on how much to place buy
# 3 weights on time of day (9-10:30, 10:30-Noon, Noon-2:30, 2:30-4)
# 1yr indicates Day_Allocation from Total Funds (2 funds, Long, Day)
# RSI (20-50 % weight for Trade_Funds)
# Mac (50-80 % weight for Trade_Funds)

    > if they contradict lean to 1 days and lower Trade_Funds
    > If VIX in between relative mean lower Trade_Funds
